Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and odd indexes separately, and return as shown below. Index 0 will be considered even.

For example, capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']. See test cases for more examples.

The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces.

*** I spent more time on the UI challenge and the regex kata and didn't have as much time to work on this one.  I did what I could in the little time that I had but will work on this more when I get a chance and resubmit.

My thought process was going through the array and taking out the even indexes, put those in their own array, capitalize those and then join the array back together somehow to return the correct result.
