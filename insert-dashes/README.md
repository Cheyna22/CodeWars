Write a function insertDash(num)/InsertDash(int num) that will insert dashes ('-') between each two odd numbers in num. For example: if num is 454793 the output should be 4547-9-3. Don't count zero as an odd number.

The process for this challenge was deciding to make a for loop that would check the numbers against each other to see if they were odd.
